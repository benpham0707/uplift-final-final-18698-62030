# UC System Admissions Calibration: What UCs Actually Value

**Purpose**: Calibrate portfolio scanner specifically for **UC Berkeley, UCLA, and general UC system admissions**

**Critical Context**: UCs use **comprehensive review** with 14 factors, NOT the same as Ivy League holistic review

---

## The UC Difference: Why This Matters

### UC Comprehensive Review vs Ivy Holistic Review

**Key Differences**:
1. ✅ **Test-blind** (don't consider SAT/ACT even if submitted)
2. ✅ **GPA-centric** but context-adjusted (weighted GPA heavily emphasized)
3. ✅ **13 factors evaluated** (official UC comprehensive review criteria)
4. ✅ **Public mission** (prioritize California residents, first-gen, low-income)
5. ✅ **PIQs are HUGE** (4 required Personal Insight Questions, 350 words each)
6. ✅ **No interviews, no legacy preference**

## UC-Specific Dimension Weights

### For UC Berkeley

```typescript
const UC_BERKELEY_WEIGHTS = {
  academicExcellence: 0.35,        // Highest - research university
  intellectualCuriosity: 0.25,     // Research emphasis
  authenticityVoice: 0.20,         // PIQs matter
  leadershipInitiative: 0.15,      // Impact-driven
  futureReadiness: 0.03,
  communityImpact: 0.02
};
```

**Rationale**:
- Berkeley is **research powerhouse** - academics + curiosity most important
- PIQs are 4 essays (1,400 words total) - major factor
- Leadership matters but academic strength is primary

### For UCLA

```typescript
const UCLA_WEIGHTS = {
  authenticityVoice: 0.30,         // Highest - essays are HUGE
  academicExcellence: 0.30,        // Co-equal with voice
  communityImpact: 0.20,           // "Bruin values"
  leadershipInitiative: 0.15,      // Well-rounded
  intellectualCuriosity: 0.03,
  futureReadiness: 0.02
};
```

**Rationale**:
- UCLA values **voice and community** - PIQs can make/break
- Well-rounded profiles preferred
- Community engagement (service) heavily valued

### For General UC System

```typescript
const GENERAL_UC_WEIGHTS = {
  academicExcellence: 0.40,        // GPA is primary
  authenticityVoice: 0.20,         // PIQs required
  leadershipInitiative: 0.15,      // Involvement expected
  communityImpact: 0.10,           // Service valued
  intellectualCuriosity: 0.10,
  futureReadiness: 0.05
};
```

## PIQ Importance at UCs (Critical Differentiator)

### Why PIQs Matter More at UCs Than Essays at Other Schools

**Research Finding**: UCs require **4 PIQs (1,400 words total)** vs most schools' 1-2 essays

**UCLA Admissions Director**: "PIQs allow us to see the person behind the GPA"

**Berkeley Admissions**: "We're looking for students who will contribute to our community. PIQs show us who you are."

### PIQ Evaluation at Top UCs

**Exceptional PIQs (9-10/10)**:
- Authentic voice throughout all 4 essays
- Specific, detailed narratives (not generic)
- Shows vulnerability and growth
- Demonstrates UC values (leadership, service, intellectual curiosity)
- Clear fit with specific UC campus

**Strong PIQs (7-8/10)**:
- Clear communication of experiences
- Some specificity and personality
- Addresses prompts directly
- Shows genuine passion

**Weak PIQs (4-6/10)**:
- Generic responses ("I learned leadership means...")
- Resume rehash without depth
- No personality or voice
- Doesn't demonstrate fit

**Poor PIQs (<4/10)**:
- Unclear writing
- Doesn't answer prompts
- Clichéd or robotic
- Too short or superficial

---

## Context Factor at UCs (Heavily Weighted)

### UC's Public Mission

**UC Comprehensive Review explicitly considers**:
- First-generation college student status
- Family income and socioeconomic status
- School resources (# of APs offered, counselor ratio)
- Family responsibilities (work, caring for siblings)
- Geographic location (rural, urban, underserved)
- Challenges overcome (personal, family, community)

### Context Adjustments (More Generous Than Ivies)

**First-Generation**:
- +0.5-1.0 GPA equivalent boost
- Lower EC expectations (work for family counts heavily)
- Essay about navigating college process highly valued

**Low-Income**:
- Work experience valued as much as ECs
- Fewer APs acceptable if school/finances limited
- Self-taught skills get extra credit

**Under-Resourced Schools**:
- Taking ALL available APs = "most rigorous" even if only 3-4
- Local/school achievements valued (fewer state/national opportunities)
- Community college courses show initiative

**Example**:
- Student A: 4.1 weighted GPA, well-resourced school (offers 20 APs, took 6) = Not most rigorous
- Student B: 4.1 weighted GPA, under-resourced school (offers 4 APs, took 4) = Most rigorous ✓

## UC-Specific Scoring Adjustments

### Profile Evaluation for Berkeley

```typescript
function evaluateForBerkeley(dimensions: DimensionScores): number {
  const weights = UC_BERKELEY_WEIGHTS;

  // Berkeley-specific bonuses
  let bonus = 0;

  // Research experience = major boost
  if (dimensions.intellectualCuriosity >= 8.5 && hasResearchExperience) {
    bonus += 0.5; // Research is huge at Berkeley
  }

  // STEM excellence for STEM majors
  if (intendedMajor.isSTEM && dimensions.academicExcellence >= 9.0) {
    bonus += 0.3;
  }

  // First-gen + high achievement
  if (isFirstGen && dimensions.academicExcellence >= 8.5) {
    bonus += 0.5; // Berkeley values first-gen scholars
  }

  const baseScore = calculateWeightedAverage(dimensions, weights);
  return Math.min(10, baseScore + bonus);
}
```

### Profile Evaluation for UCLA

```typescript
function evaluateForUCLA(dimensions: DimensionScores): number {
  const weights = UCLA_WEIGHTS;

  // UCLA-specific bonuses
  let bonus = 0;

  // Exceptional PIQs = huge boost
  if (dimensions.authenticityVoice >= 9.0) {
    bonus += 0.7; // Essays matter most at UCLA
  }

  // Community service leadership
  if (dimensions.communityImpact >= 8.0 && dimensions.leadershipInitiative >= 8.0) {
    bonus += 0.5; // "Bruin values"
  }

  // Well-rounded excellence (no weak dimensions)
  const allDimensionsAbove7 = Object.values(dimensions).every(score => score >= 7.0);
  if (allDimensionsAbove7) {
    bonus += 0.3; // UCLA loves well-rounded
  }

  const baseScore = calculateWeightedAverage(dimensions, weights);
  return Math.min(10, baseScore + bonus);
}
```

## Implementation: 3 UC Modes

### Mode 1: UC Berkeley Standard

**Target Users**: Students applying to Berkeley (STEM focus, research emphasis)

**Evaluation Priorities**:
1. Academic rigor + GPA (4.2+ weighted competitive)
2. Research experience or STEM competitions
3. PIQ quality (intellectual curiosity evident)
4. Leadership with impact

**Feedback Style**: "Berkeley seeks future researchers and scholars. Your academic profile is strong (4.25 GPA, 12 APs), but what independent intellectual work have you done? Consider..."

### Mode 2: UCLA Standard

**Target Users**: Students applying to UCLA (holistic, service-oriented)

**Evaluation Priorities**:
1. PIQ quality (authentic voice, compelling stories)
2. Academic excellence (4.25+ weighted competitive)
3. Community engagement and service
4. Well-rounded profile

**Feedback Style**: "UCLA values Bruins who contribute to community. Your PIQs are strong (8.5/10 authenticity), and your community service leadership stands out. To strengthen further..."

### Mode 3: General UC Standard

**Target Users**: Students applying to mid-tier UCs (Davis, Irvine, Santa Barbara, San Diego)

**Evaluation Priorities**:
1. Solid GPA (4.0-4.2 weighted)
2. Good rigor (6-8 APs)
3. Consistent involvement (2-3 activities, multi-year)
4. Clear PIQs

**Feedback Style**: "Your profile is competitive for UC Davis/Irvine (4.12 weighted GPA, 7 APs, sustained involvement). Your PIQs clearly communicate your experiences..."

## Summary: Key Differences from Ivy Calibration

| Factor | Ivy League | UC System |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Test Scores** | Optional (considered) | Blind (not considered) |
| **GPA Weight** | Baseline (everyone has 4.0) | Primary differentiator (4.15-4.34) |
| **Essays** | 1-2 essays | 4 PIQs (1,400 words) - HUGE |
| **Context** | Considered | **Heavily weighted** (public mission) |
| **Legacy** | Considered | Not considered |
| **Leadership** | National/Tier 1 preferred | State/school acceptable |
| **Diversity** | Holistic | First-gen/low-income **prioritized** |

**Result**: UC calibration emphasizes GPA + PIQs + Context more than Ivies
